# Screenshots are not decoration in a mobile README — they are the only part of
# the documentation that shows what the thing actually looks like, and prose
# describing a screen is a picture nobody can see. They are also the first part
# to rot, so this exists to make retaking the whole set cheap rather than a
# chore somebody skips.

# Width is halved to 540px — sharp at the ~260px the README renders them at —
# and the result is quantised to a 256-colour palette. A flat dark UI has very
# few distinct colours, so that is visually lossless here and cuts each file
# from ~550 KB to ~90 KB. Ten screenshots then cost about a megabyte rather
# than five, which is the difference between documentation and a payload.
