"""Fail if the launch screen or the mark is not what the palette says.

Three claims, each read from the source that makes it:

1.  The launch screen is painted the palette's dark surface, so there is no
    white flash on handover to the splash. Read from the asset catalogue's
    colour set and compared with Palette.swift.
2.  Info.plist points the launch screen at that colour set.
3.  The icon and docs/mark.png are what `scripts/brandmark.py` draws today.
    Drawn again to a temporary file and compared byte for byte, so a palette
    change that was not followed by `make brandmark` fails here.
