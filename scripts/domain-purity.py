"""Fail if the domain package imports anything, or reaches for the platform.

ADR-0002: `TenderDomain/` imports nothing — not Foundation. The Swift standard
library only. So the rule a gate can read is one line: no `import` statement
of any kind. Stricter than Harvest's Dart rule, which allows a short list, and
affordable because the domain is small and numeric.

The second half is the same everywhere in this portfolio: the clock and the
dice arrive as arguments, never as globals. In Swift the tempting names are
`Date()`, `DispatchTime.now()`, `ProcessInfo`, `.random(` and `arc4random`.
Foundation is banned already, so most of these cannot compile — but the gate
names them anyway, because a gate that relies on the compiler to enforce a
rule it describes is a gate that stops working the day somebody adds an import.

Proved to fire: each banned thing, added on purpose, turns this red.
